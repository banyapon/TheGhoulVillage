# TheGhoulVillage
[**TheGhoulVillage**](https://daydev.itch.io/theghoulvillage) is a horror game developed using Unity for the [**Thailand Horror Jam 2024**](https://itch.io/jam/thailand-horror-jam-2024), themed around **folklore**. This project draws inspiration from the chilling tales of ghouls, a prominent figure in **Thai folklore**, and incorporates educational technology to solve the Josephus Problem.

## Gameplay
Players find themselves trapped in a village haunted by ghouls. To escape, they must solve a series of puzzles based on the Josephus Problem. This classic mathematical problem involves selecting elements from a circular list in a specific order. In our game, players must apply logical reasoning and strategic thinking to determine the correct sequence of actions to survive.

## Josephus Problem
**The Josephus Problem** is a mathematical puzzle where n people are standing in a circle and counting around them from a certain point until every kth person is eliminated. The last person remaining is the "survivor".

## Mathematical Representation:
Let **f(n, k)** be the position of the survivor when there are *n* people initially and you count *k* people each time.
+ f(1, k) = 1
+ f(n, k) = (f(n-1, k) + k) mod n
